Graphically front-ended via the iPython notebook for exploration. \r\n\r\nDirectory: PAUPExampleFile\r\nContains: Sample of PAUP file used in Analyses to generate Table 2.\r\n\r\nDirectory: Scripts\r\nContains: Analysis scripts used for paper. Heatmap_data_gen.R performs the model-fitting used to generate Figure 4. Heatmap.py actually makes the heatmap shown on figure four from the raw data output by Heatmap_data_gen.R. Bisse.R is used to run the \r\nBiSSE analysis described in methods, with results shown on Figures 3 and 5. \r\n\r\nDirectory: TreePL\r\nContains: Configuration file for TreePL dating.\r\n\r\nDirectory: Trees\r\nContains: Three sets of trees: raw, uncalibrated trees, calibrated trees and trees with BiSSE states annotated to them. Raw and time-scaled trees each contain four trees, as described in the methods section. BiSSE-Annotated contains twelve trees: each of the four trees having been run with three parameter configurations in BiSSE.\r\n\r\nMakefiles: Makefiles reproduce the analyses completed. Makefile will run the BiSSE model-fitting to each of the four time-scaled trees with each of the 3 parameter settings (correcting for sampling bias). This will run a while. Makefileheat will reproduce the heatmap data. This will run for a long while. We have also included a Dockerfile contributed by Kyle R. Kelley (rgbkrk@gmail.com) that reproduces the R language setup needed to run our code.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
